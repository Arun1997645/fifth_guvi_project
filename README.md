SolarGuard: Intelligent Defect Detection on Solar Panels using Deep Learning

Domain: Renewable Energy & Computer Vision
Skills Demonstrated: Data Cleaning, EDA, Deep Learning (CNN), Image Classification, Streamlit, Model Evaluation
Project by: Aunkumar R
Institution/Program: AIML GUVI Projects - Fifth Project

Project Overview

Solar energy is a vital renewable resource, but environmental factors like dust, snow, bird droppings, and physical/electrical damage significantly reduce solar panel efficiency. Manual inspection is time-consuming and costly.

SolarGuard is an AI-powered system that automates the detection of solar panel defects using deep learning. It classifies panel conditions and provides actionable maintenance recommendations — enabling smart solar farms, optimized maintenance, and maximum energy output.

Problem Statement

Automatically classify solar panel images into one of six conditions:
1. Clean
2. Dusty
3. Bird-Drop
4. Electrical-Damage
5. Physical-Damage
6. Snow-Covered

Additionally, provide insights and recommendations to improve maintenance efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Object Detection (Optional): Localization of defects using bounding boxes — planned for future enhancement.

Key Objectives

- Automated Inspection: Replace manual checks with AI-driven image classification.
- Efficiency Monitoring: Analyze how defects impact performance.
- Maintenance Optimization: Recommend timely cleaning/repair actions.
- Smart Integration: Deploy via a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions.
